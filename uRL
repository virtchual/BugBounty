                                                                                URL(Uniform Resource Locator)

                                                                  Scheme://User@Host:Port/Path?Query String=value#Fragment


Scheme: This instructs on what protocol to use for accessing the resource such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

User: Some services require authentication to log in, you can put a username and password into the URL to log in.

Host: The domain name or IP address of the server you wish to access.

Port: The Port that you are going to connect to, usually 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS, but this can be hosted on any port between 1 - 65535.

Path: The file name or location of the resource you are trying to access.

Query String: Extra bits of information that can be sent to the requested path. For example, /blog?id=1 would tell the blog path that you wish to receive the blog article with the id of 1.

Fragment: This is a reference to a location on the actual page requested. This is commonly used for pages with long content and can have a certain part of the page directly linked to it, so it is viewable to the user as soon as they access the page.

Example Request:

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: domain.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/87.0
Referer: https://domain.com/
 
.......................................
To breakdown each line of this request:

Line 1: This request is sending the GET method ( more on this in the HTTP Methods task ), request the home page with / and telling the web server we are using HTTP protocol version 1.1.

Line 2: We tell the web server we want the website domain.com

Line 3: We tell the web server we are using the Firefox version 87 Browser

Line 4: We are telling the web server that the web page that referred us to this one is https://domain.com

Line 5: HTTP requests always end with a blank line to inform the web server that the request has finished.
................................................................................................................................................................................................
Example Response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.15.8
Date: Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:34:03 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 98

<html>
<head>
    <title>domain</title>
</head>
<body>
    Welcome To domain.com
</body>
</html>
.................................................................................................................................................................................................
To breakdown each line of the response:

Line 1: HTTP 1.1 is the version of the HTTP protocol the server is using and then followed by the HTTP Status Code in this case "200 Ok" which tells us the request has completed successfully.

Line 2: This tells us the web server software and version number.

Line 3: The current date, time and timezone of the web server.

Line 4: The Content-Type header tells the client what sort of information is going to be sent, such as HTML, images, videos, pdf, XML.

Line 5: Content-Length tells the client how long the response is, this way we can confirm no data is missing.

Line 6: HTTP response contains a blank line to confirm the end of the HTTP response.

Lines 7-14: The information that has been requested, in this instance the homepage.

100-199 - Information Response	These are sent to tell the client the first part of their request has been accepted and they should continue sending the rest of their request. These codes are no longer very common.
200-299 - Success	This range of status codes is used to tell the client their request was successful.
300-399 - Redirection	These are used to redirect the client's request to another resource. This can be either to a different webpage or a different website altogether.
400-499 - Client Errors	Used to inform the client that there was an error with their request.
500-599 - Server Errors	This is reserved for errors happening on the server-side and usually indicate quite a major problem with the server handling the request.

Common HTTP Status Codes:

200 - OK:The request was completed successfully.
201 - Created:	A resource has been created (for example a new user or new blog post).
301 - Moved Permanently:	This redirects the client's browser to a new webpage or tells search engines that the page has moved somewhere else and to look there instead.
302 - Found:	Similar to the above permanent redirect, but as the name suggests, this is only a temporary change and it may change again in the near future.
400 - Bad Request:	This tells the browser that something was either wrong or missing in their request. This could sometimes be used if the web server resource that is being requested expected a certain parameter that the client didn't send.
401 - Not Authorised:	You are not currently allowed to view this resource until you have authorised with the web application, most commonly with a username and password.
403 - Forbidden:	You do not have permission to view this resource whether you are logged in or not.
405 - Method Not Allowed:	The resource does not allow this method request, for example, you send a GET request to the resource /create-account when it was expecting a POST request instead.
404 - Page Not Found:	The page/resource you requested does not exist.
500 - Internal Service Error:	The server has encountered some kind of error with your request that it doesn't know how to handle properly.
